Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, as part of the "Cracking the Market Code with AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis" project. The model leverages historical stock data to forecast future closing prices, utilizing Python, TensorFlow, and other data science libraries.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict stock prices using time series analysis with an LSTM model. The dataset includes historical stock data with features such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. The LSTM model is trained to capture temporal patterns and predict future closing prices, with performance evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical stock data in CSV format. Key columns include:

Date: The date of the stock data.
Open: The opening price of the stock.
High: The highest price during the day.
Low: The lowest price during the day.
Close: The closing price (target variable for prediction).
Volume: The trading volume.

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. You can download it from Kaggle and place it in the project directory as stock_data.csv.
Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies. Clone the repository and install the required packages:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements
The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
matplotlib

Install them using:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib

Usage

Place the stock_data.csv file in the project root directory.
Run the main script to train the model and generate predictions:python lstm_stock_prediction.py


The script will:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train the LSTM model.
Generate predictions for the test set.
Save a plot of actual vs. predicted stock prices as stock_predictions.png.



Code Structure

lstm_stock_prediction.py: Main script containing the LSTM model, data preprocessing, and visualization logic.
stock_data.csv: Input dataset (to be downloaded and placed in the directory).
stock_predictions.png: Output file containing plots of actual vs. predicted prices.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).

Model Details
The LSTM model is designed to predict stock prices based on historical sequences. Key components include:

Data Preprocessing:
Missing values are handled using forward fill and interpolation.
Data is scaled using MinMaxScaler for LSTM compatibility.
Sequences of 10 time steps are created for training.


Model Architecture:
Two LSTM layers (100 and 50 units) with dropout (20%) to prevent overfitting.
A dense output layer to predict the next time step's features.
Compiled with the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.


Training:
80% of the data is used for training, 20% for testing.
Trained for 50 epochs with a validation split of 10% and early stopping.


Evaluation:
Predictions are compared to actual values using MAE and RMSE.
Visualizations include line plots of actual vs. predicted prices for each stock feature.



Results
The model generates predictions for the test set, visualized in stock_predictions.png. The plots show actual vs. predicted prices for each stock feature (e.g., Close, Open). Key observations:

The LSTM model effectively captures trends during stable market conditions.
Performance may degrade during high volatility, as noted in the project documentation.
MAE and RMSE metrics are computed to quantify prediction accuracy (see console output during training).
